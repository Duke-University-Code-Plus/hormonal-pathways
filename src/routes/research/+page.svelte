    Research Introduction
</div>
<div class="flex m-5 max-w-[1000px] m-auto flex-col gap-4">
<p>
    Our stakeholderâ€™s unpublished research paper primarily involves the idea that hormonal systems are crucial evolutionary developments that regulate many essential behavioral and physiological functions. They play a key role in the evolution and development of complex phenotypes, influencing major life-history trade-offs.

    Hormone systems have several key features:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>
    1. <b>Conservation across species:</b> Hormonal systems are remarkably conserved at the molecular level, with hormone molecules and receptor distributions being very similar across various animal species.
    </li>
    <br>
    <li>
    2. <b>Diverse phenotypic and behavioral influence:</b> Despite their conservation, hormonal systems underlie much of the diversity in organismal phenotypes and behaviors. They coordinate the expression of various physiological, morphological, and behavioral traits by acting on multiple target tissues sensitive to the hormone.
    </li>
    <br>
    <li>
    3. <b>Hormonal pleiotropy:</b> Hormonal pleiotropy refers to the ability of one hormonal signal to interact with multiple targets, thus influencing multiple traits. This feature allows for the coordination of suites of traits, such as with mating. Hormones play a key role in synchronizing gamete maturation and mating behaviors.
    </li>
    <br>
    <li>
    4. <b> Evolutionary constraint:</b> Hormonal systems may act as an evolutionary constraint, slowing down the rate of evolution and reducing the probability that an organism will be able to adapt quickly enough to changing environments. This is because the same hormonal signal might not be optimal for all traits it influences and the organism is limited in the extent to which it can change the coupling between a hormone and a trait. 
    </li> 
</ol>
<br>
<b>
How can we examine these key features?
</b>
<br>
<b>Dynamic State Variable Model:</b> The mathematical model that is used in this project aims to understand how hormonal signal levels and target tissue sensitivity are optimized over time under various environmental conditions and selection pressures. This model seeks to explore whether hormone sensitivity has more effect on trait expression than hormone concentration.
<br>
<b>Application example:</b> The model is applied to the trade-off between mating effort and parental care in seasonally-breeding male birds, such as dark-eyed juncos, where these questions have been examined in real populations. The steroid hormone testosterone is hypothesized to mediate this trade-off, influencing behaviors such as courtship displays and territory size, but also reducing parental care and immune function.
<br>
Hormonal systems are integral to the regulation of complex traits and behaviors. Understanding their evolutionary constraints and potentials can provide insights into the diverse adaptations seen in the animal kingdom.
