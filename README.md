# Hormonal Pathways and Trait Expression Simulator 

[Live Project](https://hormonal-pathways-e41a56ba4fc9.herokuapp.com/)

## Overview

This project is an interactive simulation tool designed to help researchers and students explore the dynamic relationship between hormone sensitivity and reproductive fitness in male songbirds. By manipulating key parameters like hormone concentrations and tissue sensitivity, users can visualize the impact of these factors on reproductive success over time.

### Research Context
The simulator is based on the dynamic state variable model developed by Dr. Nicole Baran, Ph.D., in behavioral neuroendocrinology. The model provides insights into how hormone receptor sensitivity, rather than just hormone concentration, plays a critical role in influencing various traits related to reproductive fitness. This forward-looking model aims to optimize fitness at each reproductive cycle by adjusting hormone sensitivity across different tissues.

## Features

### 1. Graphical Visualizations
- **Interactive Sliders**: Control hormone concentration, tissue sensitivity, and other variables through easy-to-use sliders.
- **Multi-Run Simulations**: Compare how varying specific inputs across multiple runs affects reproductive outcomes.
- **Statistics & Model Insights**: Generate visual and statistical outputs to deepen your understanding of the hormone-receptor interaction model.

### 2. Tissue-Level Simulation
- **User-Controlled Inputs**: Explore how hormone receptor counts and hormone concentration influence trait expression in male songbirds.
- **Dynamic Legends & Buttons**: Toggle between visualizations and legends that clarify the behavior of the model.

### 3. Environmental Simulation
- **Interactive Traits Visualization**: View how a birdâ€™s ability to regulate hormone sensitivity affects multiple traits, including reproductive behaviors, across breeding cycles.

### Next Steps
- **AI Integration**: Add AI-generated explanations for model outputs to enhance usability for diverse audiences.
- **Mobile Compatibility**: Improve accessibility features for mobile devices.
- **Reproductive Cycles**: Incorporate full reproductive cycles to better link tissue sensitivity to reproductive outcomes.
- **User Testing**: Conduct testing with target audiences to refine the user experience.
- **Publishing**: Collaborate with Dr. Baran to publish the simulator alongside her research.

# create-svelte

Everything you need to build a Svelte project, powered by [`create-svelte`](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/tree/main/packages/create-svelte).

## Creating a project

If you're seeing this, you've probably already done this step. Congrats!

```bash
# create a new project in the current directory
npm create svelte@latest

# create a new project in my-app
npm create svelte@latest my-app
```

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters) for your target environment.
